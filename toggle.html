          <h1>Mayonnaise</h1>
          <p>Mayonnaise, informally mayo,[1] is a thick cold condiment or dressing commonly used in sandwiches, hamburgers, and composed salads, and on French fries. It is also as a base in sauces such as tartar sauce.

It is basically a stable emulsion of oil, egg yolk, and an acid, either vinegar or lemon juice;[2] there are many variants using additional flavorings. The proteins and lecithin in the egg yolk serve as emulsifiers in mayonnaise.[3] The color of mayonnaise varies from near-white to pale yellow, and its texture from a light cream to a thick gel.

Commercial egg-free alternatives are made for vegans and those who avoid chicken eggs or dietary cholesterol.</p>
